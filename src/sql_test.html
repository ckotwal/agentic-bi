Great — I’ll start by analyzing the schema defined in the `chinook.ddl` file. Then I’ll generate a set of realistic and varied natural language queries along with chart types to comprehensively test your NL-to-SQL charting application.

### Step 1: Analyze the DDL

Let me parse the `chinook.ddl` file and extract the schema first.


The `chinook.ddl` file defines the schema of the [Chinook database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), a well-known sample database modeled after a digital media store (similar to iTunes). Here's a summary of the core tables and relationships it contains:

---

### ✅ **Key Tables and Fields**

1. **Artist(ArtistId, Name)**
2. **Album(AlbumId, Title, ArtistId)** — many-to-one with Artist
3. **Track(TrackId, Name, AlbumId, MediaTypeId, GenreId, Composer, Milliseconds, Bytes, UnitPrice)**
4. **Genre(GenreId, Name)**
5. **MediaType(MediaTypeId, Name)**
6. **Customer(CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country, Email, etc.)**
7. **Invoice(InvoiceId, CustomerId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry, Total)** — many-to-one with Customer
8. **InvoiceLine(InvoiceLineId, InvoiceId, TrackId, UnitPrice, Quantity)** — many-to-one with Invoice and Track
9. **Playlist(PlaylistId, Name)**
10. **PlaylistTrack(PlaylistId, TrackId)** — many-to-many via junction table
11. **Employee(EmployeeId, ReportsTo, FirstName, LastName, Title, etc.)**

### ✅ **Realistic Natural Language Queries with Chart Types**

Below is a diverse set of test queries for your app, with recommended visualizations:

Would you like me to generate the corresponding SQL queries as well for each of these?
